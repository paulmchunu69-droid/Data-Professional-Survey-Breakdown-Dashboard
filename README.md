# Data-Professional-Survey-Breakdown-Dashboard

This project analyzes survey responses from 630 data professionals to better understand salaries, skills, job satisfaction, and industry trends. The report was built using Power BI, featuring interactive visuals that highlight key insights about the modern data workforce.

## Project Objective

To explore and visualize survey data from data professionals around the world, uncovering trends in job roles, salary, programming languages, career difficulty, and overall satisfaction — and to present insights that help aspiring and existing data workers make informed career decisions.

## Key Questions / KPIs

What countries do most survey participants come from?

How do salaries differ across data job roles?

Which programming languages are most popular in the field?

How satisfied are data professionals with their salary and work-life balance?

How difficult is it to break into the data industry?

What is the average age of survey respondents?

## Process

Imported survey dataset into Power BI

Data cleaning & transformation in Power Query (renamed columns, formatted values, created calculated fields)

Built interactive visuals and measures using DAX

Designed a single-page dashboard emphasizing readability and insight discovery

Added slicers, tooltips, and advanced charts to support exploration

## Project Insights

The United States represents the largest share of respondents, followed by India.

Data scientists and data engineers report the highest average salaries.

Python is by far the most popular programming language among professionals.

The average respondent rates work-life balance higher (5.7/10) than salary satisfaction (4.2/10).

Nearly half of respondents say breaking into data is “neither easy nor difficult,” but many still find it challenging.

The average age of a data professional in this sample is around 30.

## Final Conclusion

The survey reveals a growing but competitive data industry where Python dominates, salaries vary significantly by role, and many professionals feel only moderately satisfied with compensation. Despite this, work-life balance scores are higher, and most respondents believe entering the field is possible — though not effortless. These findings can help both employers and new entrants understand the realities of working in data today
